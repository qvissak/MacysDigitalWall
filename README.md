### Digital Media Browse Wall
The basis of our idea is an in-store digital browse media that will allow customers to more efficiently shop, and subsequently increse the Macy's in-store sales. Our goal is to enhance the customer's in-store experience by presenting valuable product information through interactive displays and ultimately providing a cleaner shopping environment.
